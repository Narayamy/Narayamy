Hi there, I am Sarah Narayamy, I am a driven person with more than five years experience with costumer service.

Since I am starting my carrer in the computing field, my goal is to learn. I believe knowledge is one of the best ways to improve either as a person and as a professional.

Now that you have a peek of my work and what I have learned so far, please feel free to leave a feedback,
or if you want you can help me learn more, so do not shy yourself from sharing a bit of your knowledge.

Thank you for having the time to have a look at my work. Wish you the very best.
